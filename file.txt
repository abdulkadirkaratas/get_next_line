World War II or the Second World War was a global conflict that
lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast majority of the world's countries,
including all the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military
alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participating countries invested
all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities into
this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military
resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing
of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever
used in war. It was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting
in 70â€“85 million fatalities. Millions died due to genocides, including the
Holocaust, as well as starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of
Axis defeat, Germany, Austria, and Japan were occupied, and war crime tribunals
were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.
